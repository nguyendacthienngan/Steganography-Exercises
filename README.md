# Steganography-Exercises
Steganography is the art and science of hiding information in a cover document such as digital images in a
way that conceals the existence of hidden data. [1]
> The word steganography in Greek means “covered writing” ( Greek words “stegos” meaning “cover” and “grafia” meaning “writing”) [2].
The main objective of steganography is to communicate securely in such a way that the true message is not visible to the observer.

In this repository, I will present some techniques I learnt from this course.
